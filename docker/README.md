# grafana-on-raspberry through docker
[Grafana](http://grafana.org) *unofficial* docker image for armhf.

The build process closely follows the [official
one](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-docker). You can get the image from
[dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fg2it/grafana-armhf/).

Obviously, you will need docker to run a container. The easiest way might be to
use [hypriot deb package](http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/).
